The contents of this compressed folder include the following: 


1. Subject Data_mat format: This folder contains the accelerometer data of all subjects in .mat (MATLAB) format. 

2. Subject Data_txt format: This folder contains the accelerometer data of all subjects in .txt format. 

3. Activity Timings:  This folder contains the timing information of the indoor and outdoor activities.

4. GroundTruth: This is a MATLAB .mat structure that contains the ground truth information obtained from the FSR sensors. 

5. mainScript.m: This is an example MATLAB script on how to extract desired information from the datasets provided. 

6. Polarvis.m : Is the implementation of VIDGA system

7. Polarvis.fig : Provides the Matlab GUI required for arrangmanet of different axes 

8. Kitten.mp4 : Shows the video of a cat walking on a treadmile 

9. Videoplayback.mp4:  Shows thevideo of  rehabilitation processon on a treadmile 


9. Videoplayback.mp4:  Shows thevideo of  rehabilitation processon on a treadmile 

10. VIDGA.wmv  Shows how different features of VIDGA system


In order to run the system first run the mainScript.m file and select the data that you are willing to run analysis on 

For example :   parcticipant 4  
		actIndex: 3 -> treadWalknRun    
		accPos: 1 -> Left Foot
Then run the Polarvis.m
